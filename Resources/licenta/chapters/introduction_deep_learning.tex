\section{Theoretical Background}
\subsection{Introduction to Deep Learning}
This section briefly introduces the concept of deep learning.
\paragraph{
	Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to effectively perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model of sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering, and computer vision, where it is infeasible to develop an algorithm of specific instructions for performing the task. The represantation of data fed into a ML algorithm plays a major role, as it affects the algorithmâ€™s ability to efficiently extract signals and make decisions. Thus, it is important to carefully select the information included in such a representation. Formally, the representation is com- posed of multiple features extracted from raw data. The process of creating new features requires good and intuitive understanding of the data at hand, becoming incrementally time-consuming with the sophistication of the new features. Thus, the biggest challenge of handcrafted features is deciding which features are important and relevant to the problem \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}
