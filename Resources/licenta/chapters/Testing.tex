\subsection{Testing}

The application was tested using unit-testing for various components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Path validators were given non-existing, existing paths, directories when testing for normal files and vice versa.
	\item Preprocessing utils were tested to see if the songs are split into the correct number of windows
	\item One-hot encoding and decoding utils
	
	Code snippets will be added here
\end{itemize}
